# 💳 Bankist – Bank Simulation App

## Overview
Bankist is a minimalist banking simulation app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It focuses on **JavaScript interactivity** to simulate core banking features such as money transfers, loan requests, and account management.

This project was developed as part of my JavaScript learning journey, following the course by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.
